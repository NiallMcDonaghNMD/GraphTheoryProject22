# Graph theory project

Welcome to my graph theory project for 2022 for 3rd year Software Development at ATU (GMIT).

This repository/github project exists for a module I have to complete for GMIT/ATU. The module is called "Graph Theory" and is all about the subject matter of its name.
As part of my assessment, I was required to create two jupyter notebooks based upon Graph Theory. One being the Heap Sort Algorithm and the other being the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
Both have been interesting and intriguing to investigate, research and learn how and why they exist.

## Projects contents
The project contains a few files. Primarily the two .ipynb jupyter notebook files which hold the main projects work, amongst an images folder which has images that are linked to the notebooks. A videos folder containing a video in relation to Heap Sort, and this README.MD file you are currently reading.

## Project Prerequisites

In order to open up the notebooks, you require Python and Jupyter notebooks AND git.

These are the following pieces of software needed to run the project:
- Jupyter notebook = https://jupyter.org/install

![Jupyter website](readme_images/jupyterSite.png?raw=true "Jupter website")


- Python = https://www.python.org/downloads/

![Python website](/readme_images/pythonSite.PNG?raw=true "Python website")

## Downloading the project

On the main github project page, navigate to the top of the page and select "Code". 

![Code button for github project download](/readme_images/gitCodeButton.png?raw=true "Code button for github project download")

Click "Download ZIP" from the "Code" dropdown menu.

Upon clicking "Download", you will see a .zip folder somewhere in your browser (dependent on what browser. In this next example I use Google Chrome)

![Zip downloaded and shown within Google Chrome browser](/readme_images/GitZipFolder.png?raw=true "Zip downloaded and shown within Google Chrome browser")

Click into this folder. Upon being inside the folder right click on the folder within and click copy. Navigate to your desktop and right click and hit "Paste".

Click into this folder on your Desktop. You should see the folders contents:

![Project folder on desktop - contents](/readme_images/projectContents.png?raw=true "Project folder on desktop - contents")

At the top of the folder where you see "GraphTheoryProject22-main" click into that line, and type "cmd". It should auto delete the commands previously there.

Hit ENTER on your keyboard. It will pop up the Command line. Provided you have the Prerequisites installed, type "jupyter notebook" into the Command line and hit ENTER:

![jupyter notebook written into Command line](/readme_images/notebookCMDline.png?raw=true "jupyter notebook written into Command line")

## Running the project notebooks

Upon entering this command, it will run Juypter Notebook for you. It will automatically open the notebook in your browser. To navigate into the specific notebook you wish click on the name. Such as "graph-isomorphism.ipynb"

![jupyter notebook main interface](/readme_images/jupyterUI.png?raw=true "jupyter notebook main interface")

Upon loading the notebook, jupyter should automatically run all the content. However, you can run the cells (each "box" with text, code etc.) individually by clicking on a cell and pressing "LEFT-SHIFT+ENTER" OR you can click on "Cell" on the navigational bar at the top of the page and click "Run all"

![Running all cells](/readme_images/runningCellsJupyter.png?raw=true "Running all cells")

Congratulations, you have successfully ran my jupyter notebook python project :)
