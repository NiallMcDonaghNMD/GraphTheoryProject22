Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Opening notebooks

In order to open up the notebooks, you require Python and Jupyter notebooks AND git.
(FILL IN IMAGES and more details here)

Once you have installed the necessary prerequisites, clone the github repository by creating a new folder on your desktop.
Upon creation of the folder, go into the command line window and type in CMD.
Once the CMD window is open, type git clone GITHUB URL HERE.
After completion, in the same cmd line type navigate to the newly downloaded folder by typing "cd GraphTheoryProject22".
Then, type in "jupyter notebook" into the CMD line, and it will open up a GUI to view the files within the downloaded repo.
Finally, click into the desired notebook name to view its contents.
