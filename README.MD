# Graph theory project

Welcome to my graph theory project for 2022 for 3rd year Software Development at ATU (GMIT).

## Prerequisites

In order to open up the notebooks, you require Python and Jupyter notebooks AND git.

These are the following pieces of software needed to run the project:
- Jupyter notebook = https://jupyter.org/install

![Jupyter website](https://gyazo.com/df2c7fdd1e1993fb575b36b9c2e270f8)


- Python = https://www.python.org/downloads/

![Python website](https://gyazo.com/df2c7fdd1e1993fb575b36b9c2e270f8)

## Downloading the project
```
On the main github project page, navigate to the top of the page and select "Code". 

![Code button for github project download](https://gyazo.com/5155924079e8fd321f272575562aa0d2)

Click "Download ZIP" from the "Code" dropdown menu.

Upon clicking "Download", you will see a .zip folder somewhere in your browser (dependent on what browser. In this next example I use Google Chrome)

![Zip downloaded and shown within Google Chrome browser](https://gyazo.com/f633b5e5a6de02022f1e65099a9d9c88)

Click into this folder. Upon being inside the folder right click on the folder within and click copy. Navigate to your desktop and right click and hit "Paste".

Click into this folder on your Desktop. You should see the folders contents:

![Project folder on desktop - contents](https://gyazo.com/e02dfd4fa5bc48f70e784f715ea7108e)

At the top of the folder where you see "GraphTheoryProject22-main" click into that line, and type "cmd". It should auto delete the commands previously there.

![Project folder on desktop CMD typed into file line](https://gyazo.com/3b95e933279d963b706b809dabdaf6d9)

Hit ENTER on your keyboard. It will pop up the Command line. Provided you have the Prerequisites installed, type "jupyter notebook" into the Command line and hit ENTER:

```
## Running the project notebooks
```
Upon entering this command, it will run Juypter Notebook for you. It will automatically open the notebook in your browser. To navigate into the specific notebook you wish click on the name. Such as "graph-isomorphism.ipynb"

![jupyter notebook main interface](https://gyazo.com/56181c04bc965eb0a0f41698866d304b)

Upon loading the notebook, jupyter should automatically run all the content. However, you can run the cells (each "box" with text, code etc.) individually by clicking on a cell and pressing "LEFT-SHIFT+ENTER" OR you can click on "Cell" on the navigational bar at the top of the page and click "Run all"

![Running all cells](https://gyazo.com/56181c04bc965eb0a0f41698866d304b)

Congratulations, you have successfully ran my jupyter notebook python project :)
